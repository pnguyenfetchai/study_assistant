    "last_response": "As you've mentioned that this is related to SNMP protocols, a GetBulkRequest is usually done in SNMPv2c or SNMPv3. While I can provide a step-by-step guide in general, depending on your case, you might need to reach out to an instructor or a senior engineer for a more tailor-fit solution.\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries or packages in your script/program which allow you to perform SNMP requests. For example, in Python, you might need the 'pysnmp' package.\n\n2. Specify your target agent – you need to specify the IP address of the SNMP agent you want to contact. You also need to specify the port number in case it's not the default one.\n\n3. Define the community string – SNMP uses \"communities\" to authenticate requests. A commonly used default read community string is 'public'.\n\n4. Specify the OID (object identifier) you're interested in. OIDs uniquely identify managed objects in the MIB hierarchy.\n\n5. Specify two parameters - non-repeaters and max-repetitions. Non-repeaters tell the agent how many objects in the variable bindings list should have the get-next behavior. Max-repetitions tell the agent how many get-next operations to perform on the remaining objects in the variable bindings list.\n\n6. Send the GetBulkRequest – Now that all the parameters are set, you can send a GetBulkRequest.\n\n7. Output the result – If everything is done correctly, the agent will send back a GetResponse message with the requested information (if available). You can print/parse and store this information as per your needs.\n\nRemember, a GetBulkRequest is a way to poll multiple OIDs from an SNMP-enabled device in a single request. However, too much information can overwhelm the network or agent. Therefore, make sure to set 'Max-repetitions' according to your network capacity and needs.",
