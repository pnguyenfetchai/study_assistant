    "last_response": "Based on the course content, let's assume in this semester you had 20 assignments in total. I'll use this number as a basis for this pie chart.\n\nSay, you've submitted 16 assignments and haven't submitted 4. The chart will thus represent these two categories: 'Submitted Assignments' and 'Unsubmitted Assignments'.\n\nLet me break down the percentages for you:\n\n- For the Submitted Assignments: (16/20) * 100% = 80%\n- For the Unsubmitted Assignments: (4/20) * 100% = 20%\n\nHere's the imagined visualization of the pie chart:\n\n```\n      ***********************\n     *                     *\n    *                       *\n   *        80%            *    \n  *    [Submitted]         *     \n *                         *\n *                         *\n  *                       *\n   *                     *\n     *********************\n            || 20%\n     [Unsubmitted]\n```\n\nThe larger portion represents the 80% of assignments you've submitted, and the smaller portion indicates the 20% of assignments you've not submitted yet.\n\nRemember, this chart is based on an assumption that you had 20 assignments this semester and you've submitted 16. You should adjust numbers according to your real status. \n\nAlso, be sure to keep track of your assignments and try to complete all of them to improve your learning experience and academic performance.",
