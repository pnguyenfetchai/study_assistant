    "last_response": "Based on the course content, I'm unable to extract specific data regarding the number of submitted and unsubmitted assignments. However, for illustrative purposes, let's assume there are a total of 20 assignments for this course. \n\nLet's also make an assumption that 15 assignments have been submitted, and 5 have not. Here's how we can represent these assumptions in a pie chart:\n\n>Data for the Pie Chart:\n1. Submitted Assignments: 15 (75%)\n2. Unsubmitted Assignments: 5 (25%)\n\nPie-chart:\n\n```\n---------\n|    |   |\n| S  | U |\n|    |   |\n---------\n\nLegend:\nS - Submitted Assignments (75%)\nU - Unsubmitted Assignments (25%)\n```\n\nPlease remember that the provided pie chart is a demonstration based on assumptions. Always reference the actual platform you're using (e.g., Canvas) for exact numbers about submitted and unsubmitted assignments.",
